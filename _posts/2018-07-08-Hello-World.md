title: I'm up and running!

It's been a busy summer already, and there are a few things I want to try to knock off this year:

- Public writing. I've run my [own website](https://ronspace.org) for a while, but for tech blogging this seems better.
- I took the [SANS SEC560: Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking](https://www.sans.org/course/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking) class and decided to buy the certification exam. So I'll need to study for that, and [hacks4pancakes](https://tisiphone.net/author/hacks4pancakes/) [guide](https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/) looks like a path to success.
- Work paid for the [Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PwK)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) class, so I need to knock off the [Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) cert. Before I buy another month of lab time I'd like to get some time in with [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), and [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/).
- I've been doing a lot of work with Puppet, and I think it'd be useful if I wrote up what I've learned on this, mainly using and abusing custom facts. I was thinking of presenting this at PuppetConf, but that's changing to [Puppetize Live](https://puppet.com/puppetizelive), whatever that is. I guess we'll all find out Monday.
