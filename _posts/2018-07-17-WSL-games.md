from a administrator powershell:

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux `

then install ubuntu 18.04 linux (or try another distribution)
then launch linux. After setup you'll be prompted for a username and password to log into your Linux shell.
```
sudo -s   # log into root
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get install git ruby ruby-dev ruby-rest-client 
git clone https://github.com/ronnelson/RBeenPwned-Checker.git
cd RBeenPwned-Checker/

root@Surface4:~/RBeenPwned-Checker# ruby check.rb password
"Your password was breached 3533661 times."
root@Surface4:~/RBeenPwned-Checker#
```
so... don't use password as a password.  <Grin>
