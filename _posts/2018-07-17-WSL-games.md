title: Fun with WLS
---
Now this is a game to play on a Windows 10 system: a quick look at setting up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and a demo use.

First WLS needs to be enabled. If needed, run this in a administrator powershell:

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux `

then install ubuntu 18.04 linux (or try another distribution) from the Windows Store.

Launch linux. After setup you'll be prompted for a username and password to log into your Linux shell.
```
sudo -s   # log into root
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
```
That's all that's needed to be up and running with a Linux shell on your Windows 10 box. This is not a VM but a compatability layer for running Linux binaries natively. 

So here's the first thing I did with WLS: there's a project on GitHub which uses Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned API to see if a 
password has been found in an online account dump without sending the password back to any server (by comparing its one-way hash 
to the hashs of the leaked passwords). I forked the project ([[https://github.com/ricardovsilva/RBeenPwned-Checker]] to my personal 
GitHub account so that when I'm working with it I know the copy I'm dealing with. Here's how to run the project on your own Win10
system:

```
apt-get install git ruby ruby-dev ruby-rest-client 
git clone https://github.com/ronnelson/RBeenPwned-Checker.git
cd RBeenPwned-Checker/

root@Surface4:~/RBeenPwned-Checker# ruby check.rb password
"Your password was breached 3533661 times."
root@Surface4:~/RBeenPwned-Checker#
```
so... don't use password as a password.  <Grin>
